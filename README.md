# DSA Notes

A personal collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) notes** and Java implementations.  
This repository is designed for **learning, reference, and interview preparation**, covering all major DSA topics.

## 📂 Structure
##### Each topic will be in its own folder, with some notes related to the topic and a few leetcode problems solved with several different approaches.
- Brute Force approach
- Slightly better approach
- Optimal approach

## 🧠 Topics Covered (Planned)

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Arrays | Access, insert, delete, traverse, search; common patterns like sliding window and two pointers |
| Strings | Manipulation, pattern matching, substrings, palindromes |
| Sliding Window | Fixed and variable window problems |
| Two Pointers | Fast/slow pointers, meeting point problems |
| Sorting & Searching | Merge sort, quicksort, binary search, etc. |
| Linked List | Singly, doubly, circular, and their operations |
| Stack & Queue | Stack operations, queue variations, deque, priority queue |
| Trees | Binary trees, BST, traversals, segment trees |
| Graphs | Representation, DFS/BFS, shortest path, spanning trees |
| Dynamic Programming | 1D/2D DP, memoization, tabulation |
| Greedy | Strategy, problem patterns |
| Intervals | Merging, scheduling, overlapping intervals |
| Backtracking | Permutations, combinations, N-Queens |
| Math & Geometry | Number theory, combinatorics, geometric problems |
| Matrix | 2D arrays, rotations, traversals |
| Design | System design and OOP patterns |
| Bit Manipulation | Tricks, masks, XOR patterns |
